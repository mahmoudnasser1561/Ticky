# Ticky
## Overview

This project automates the process of analyzing logs generated by ticky, an internal ticketing system. It extracts useful information from system logs, summarizes errors and actions, and generates reports in CSV format that can be converted to HTML tables for easy visualization.


### This script will create the following reports:
- The ranking of errors generated by the system: A list of all the error messages logged and how many times each error was found, sorted by the most common error to the least common error. This report doesn't take into account the users involved.

- The user usage statistics for the service: A list of all users that have used the system, including how many info messages and how many error messages they've generated. This report is sorted by username.

### How to use
```
chmod +x ticky_check.py
./ticky_check.py
```
Executing ticky_check.py will generate two report file error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv.
Now we can now visualize the error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv by converting them to HTML pages.
To do this, pass the files one by one to the script csv_to_html.py file.

```
sudo chmod o+w ../results
./csv_to_html.py error_message.csv ../results/errors.html
./csv_to_html.py user_statistics.csv ../results/user_stats.html
```
